# Bundler for AdminJS

This is a bundler utility tool for AdminJS.
Normally, AdminJS builts custom components on server's startup which can slow it down or cause high memory usage.

This tool allows you to pre-bundle AdminJS browser files before deploying or during your CI/CD process.

**IMPORTANT:** To prevent AdminJS from attempting to generate a new bundle on server startup, you must set `ADMIN_JS_SKIP_BUNDLE="true"` environment variable! `"true"` needs to be a `string`, it cannot be a `boolean`.

## AdminJS

AdminJS is an automatic admin interface which can be plugged into your application. You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminJS generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.

Check out the example application with mongo and postgres models here: https://demo.adminjs.co

Or visit [AdminJS](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs) github page.
